## Description

Portfolio is a simple webpage to demonstrate the growing skills and body of work created by webdev Jonathan Stull.

As of March 2021, these skills include basic HTML, CSS and Markdown proficiencies that Jonathan learned while attending Epicodus, a development bootcamp. Its current feature set include basic HTML page elements, CSS block and inline styling for those elements, and time permitting more complex Bootstrap styling for containers and cards.

As the course unfolds between March and September 2021, Jonathan expects to build skills in Javascript, C#/.NET and React, and this portfolio page will be updated as his skills evolve.
