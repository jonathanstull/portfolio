    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2012 with a BS in journalism. Since graduation, I have explored the world of writing in numerous ways. As a journalist, I learned how to communicate with people and translate their stories for print and web audiences. I have adapted this skill to successfully build brand narratives and web copy, write fiction, document the outdoors, and represent nonprofits via grant strategy.</p>
    <p>Writing is hard. In 2020, following periods of pandemic-related unemployment, I realized that I had found the ceiling of my writing career, and I jumped into action in three important ways.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I joined <a href="https://wvdo-or.org/" target="_blank">WVDO</a>, a nonprofit grantwriter's workshop to build new skills</li>
      <li>I worked with a Portland nonprofit, <a href="https://www.projectledo.org/" target="_blank">Project LEDO</a>, to build its grant strategy</li>
      <li>I enrolled in <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank">Epicodus</a>, a coding bootcamp, to build skills that will open new opportunities and challenges</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I'm excited to apply new skills and experience to climate-conscientious tech startups.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I have developed a loyal ethic and a commitment to creating a better world through the work that I do.
