        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2012 with a BS in journalism. Since graduation, I have explored the world of writing in numerous ways. As a journalist, I learned how to communicate with people and translate their stories for print and web au<span class="anagram">d</span>iences. I have adapted this skill to successfully build brand narratives and web copy, write fiction, document the outdoors, and represent nonprofits via grant strategy.</p>
        <p><strong>Writing is hard. In 2020, following periods of pandemic-related unemployment, I realized that I had found a ceil<span class="anagram">i</span>ng in my writing career, and I jumped into action in three important ways:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>I joined <a href="https://wvdo-or.org/" target="_blank">WVDO</a>, a nonprofit grantwriter's workshop to build new skills</li>
          <li>I joined a Portland-based economic justice nonprofit, <a href="https://www.projectledo.org/" target="_blank">Project LEDO</a>, to facilitate its grant strategy</li>
          <li>I enrolled in <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank">Epicodus</a>, a coding bootcamp, to build skills that will open new opportunities and challenges</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I'm excited to apply new skills and experience to <span class="anagram">c</span>limate-conscientious tech startups.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I have developed a loyal ethic and a commitment to creating a better world through the work that I do.</p>
